once the backup is generated, the container will exit and the backup of the master data 
will be available at /srv/docker/backups/postgresql.XXXXXXXXXXXX/. 
Restoring the backup involves starting a container with the data in /srv/docker/backups/postgresql.XXXXXXXXXXXX.


Automated Backups
The image can be configured to automatically take backups daily, weekly or monthly using the GITLAB_BACKUP_SCHEDULE configuration option.

Daily backups are created at GITLAB_BACKUP_TIME which defaults to 04:00 everyday. Weekly backups are created every Sunday at the same time as the daily backups. Monthly backups are created on the 1st of every month at the same time as the daily backups.

By default, when automated backups are enabled, backups are held for a period of 7 days. While when automated backups are disabled, the backups are held for an infinite period of time. This behavior can be configured via the GITLAB_BACKUP_EXPIRY option.
