# Docker
Docker learning and management with three different applications: Redmine, Jira and Gitlab.  

Docker container management is the research topic in this summer. Since it is the first time I know docker, I think it may be helpful for other people who are willing to learn it.

This repo mainly contains three different directories, where I use docker to setting up environments for three projects:
- gitlab
- Jira
- Redmine

Inside each directory, there are also some md files about the corresponding application.
